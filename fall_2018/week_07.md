## Last Week's Accomplishments

>  I began to implement code that will allow any port to be tied to any other port / allow them to have multiple connections.


## This Week's Plan

>  This is a fairly large implementation so I hope to finish this feature and test it to make sure it's bug-free.


## Anything Blocking?

> Still familiarizing myself with all the functions and features in the code.

## Notes

> :)
