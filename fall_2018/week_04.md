## Last Week's Accomplishments

>  I did not accomplish much last week as I had a lot of homework and studying to do for this week. However, I did take a look the new issues assigned to me, but wasn't able to work on it much.


## This Week's Plan

> Take a better look at the issues and implement some code to either start working on or reseolve the issue.


## Anything Blocking?

> I have two exams this week and some assignments do next week which will take up a lot of my time.


## Notes

> :)
