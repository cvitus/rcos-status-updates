## Last Week's Accomplishments

> In this section, you can write about what you accomplished in the previous week.

> This past week I fixed a bug in the mutiplexer and similar functions that crashed when theinput value was negative or zero. I clamped it between 1 and 8. I also discovered and fixed a synatx error where the demultiplexer would not run.

## This Week's Plan

> This coming up week, I plan to look at and hopefully fix some more minor bugs and simultaneously develop my skill in JavaScript, HTML, etc. 

## Anything Blocking?

> Nothing is blocking me as of right now :)
