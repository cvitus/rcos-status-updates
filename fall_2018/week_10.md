## Last Week's Accomplishments

>  I researched and implemented code to create most of the nine segment display by manpipulating the seven segment display feature to understand the code and then modifying it for the nine segment display.


## This Week's Plan

>  Continue to work on the nine segment feature, hopefully complete this feature and then error check my code.


## Anything Blocking?

>  I do not know how to create the additonal diagonal segments needed for the nine-segment display in order to finish the implementation.

## Notes
