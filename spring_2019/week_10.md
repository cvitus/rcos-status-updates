## Last Week's Accomplishments

> I worked on the presentation for large group. I added to our slideshow to include information on what I had done throughout the semester (test cases: Bezier, MathUtitls, ComponentUtils) and what else I'm currently workng on (keyboard component). I also prepared myself to speak as I have a crippling fear of public speaking that is ever-so-slowly decreasing. During small group on Tuesday, I practiced presenting and watched & critqued the other projects in our small group. Friday, I watched the actual presentations during large group and presented with the other members of OpenCircuits. 

## This Week's Plan

> Get back to the OpenCircuits grind and work on implementing the new keyboard component for the refactor and finish it by Saturday (the last day for commits).

## Anything Blocking?

> Trying to read the old buggy code javascript code from before the refactor to understand how the keyboard component works to convert it to clean typescript code when I'm not entirely familar with javascript.
