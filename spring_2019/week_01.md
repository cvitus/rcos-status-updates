## Last Week's Accomplishments

> I wrote unit test cases for both BezierCurve and MathUtils and in the process learned more about the code and functions. The tests included verifying the functionality of Clamp, TransformContains, RectContains and various manipulations of BezierCurve's point 1, point 2, control 1, control 2 and getBoundingBox of the BezierCurve. 

## This Week's Plan

> I plan to write to more test cases specifically for CircleContains which determines if a circle, defined by a position and a radius, contains another point.

## Anything Blocking?

>  Nope

## Notes

> :)
