## Last Week's Accomplishments

> I implemented Connect function test cases which creates a wire and connects two components ports together. I also worked on CreateGroup test cases which separates out IO Objects into inputs, outputs, wires and all other components.

## This Week's Plan

> My goal is to finish the ComponentUtils test cases for the remaining functions and then get assigned a new task.

## Anything Blocking?

> nope

## Notes
