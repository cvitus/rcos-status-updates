## Last Week's Accomplishments

> I have begun writing more test cases for CircleContains which determines if a circle, defined by a position and a radius, contains a point. I also worked on debugging the failed unit test cases for BoundingBox in Bezier Curve.

## This Week's Plan

> I hope to finish both the CircleContains test cases and fix the errors in the BoundingBox method.

## Anything Blocking?

>  Negative

## Notes

> :)
