## Last Week's Accomplishments

> Someone else fixed the wire curve bug so I was able to look at my tests for BezierCurve and verfiy they were correct to finish. I also got assigned more tests to write so I started looking at the code to understand how they work in order to properly test them.

## This Week's Plan

> I will begin writing the test cases for the functions in ComponentUtils.

## Anything Blocking?

>  n/a

## Notes

> This is a little late because I forgot to push it on git, thanks!
