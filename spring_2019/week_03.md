## Last Week's Accomplishments

> I discovered what was causing the unit test cases for BoundingBox in Bezier Curve to fail. I also pushed my CircleContains unit test cases

## This Week's Plan

> I will write more test cases.

## Anything Blocking?

>  I cannot fix the BoundingBox test case failures because it is caused by the wire curve being broken which someone else is working on. Therefore I cannot do anymore with BezierCurve until they're done which will take a little bit.
Also, I have to wait to write more test cases until the person who implemented the functions pushes them, but that shouldn't be too long.
