## Last Week's Accomplishments

> I wrote quite a few tests for the CopyGroup function of ComponentUtils, testing a variety of small and large, complex and simple circuits.

## This Week's Plan

> CopyGroup is an important function so I am going to write some more tests of increasing complexity to make sure I cover all the possibile circuits.

## Anything Blocking?

> No ma'am
