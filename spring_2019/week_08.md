## Last Week's Accomplishments

> I wrote the last few test cases for the CopyGroup function of ComponentUtils. CopyGroup was the last of the functions t be completed by me in order to test ComponentUtils. 

## This Week's Plan

> I will figure out which new assignment to start woking on. We have many open issues so I'm not entirely sure exactly what I wil be working on. I might be assigned to work on fixing a bug or implemementing a new feature on the refactor instead of writing test cases.

## Anything Blocking?

> Negative, Captain

## Notes

> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
