## Last Week's Accomplishments

> SInce I finished writing the test cases for ComponentUtils, I needed something new to work on. We have about 44 open issues on github so I was looking through those to figure out what assignment I wanted. I decided to implement the Keyboard input component. This was a feature we had on the old website, but since we began the refactor process, it had yet to be implemented back.  I began looking into what the old Keyboard component does and how it functions to understand the component in order to rewrite it better for the refactor.

## This Week's Plan

> Cotinue working on implementning the ~better than ever~ Keyboard Input Component. 

## Anything Blocking?

> I'm a little rusty on JavaScript which is what the old code is written in, but that is only a minor obstacle that I will be able to overcome in no time.
