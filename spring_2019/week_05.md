## Last Week's Accomplishments

> Last week was ~spring break~ so not much accomplished. 

## This Week's Plan

> I was assigned test cases for the functions in ComponentUtils. I implemented CreateWire test cases. There were some errors on my part, but I figured out why and fixed them. Now, the CreateWire tests are done and I will start to implement other functions in that file.

## Anything Blocking?
